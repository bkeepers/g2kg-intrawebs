<!-- Tell us a little about yourself. -->

I am a maker and breaker of things at GitHub working mostly on [Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com). When my face is not dimly lit by a computer screen, you can find me with a book in my hands, playing racquetball or basketball, running with my dog, or enjoying good food and drink with my wife. I share about my endeavors at [@bkeepers](http://twitter.com/bkeepers) and opensoul.org.

<!-- Tell us something interesting. -->

Here's one of my [favorite code snippets](https://gist.github.com/dpetersen/322146).

{% highlight ruby %}
module Kernel
  def the(a, b)
    Exception.new
  end

  def roof
  end

  def yo!
  end
end

raise the roof, yo!
{% endhighlight %}
