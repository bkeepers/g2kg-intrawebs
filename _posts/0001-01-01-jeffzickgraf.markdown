<!-- Tell us a little about yourself. -->

I work for SnapOne, Inc. which is based out of New Jersey but has a small developer office in Indianapolis. In warmish weather months you can find me riding my bike on the many new bike paths and trails in Indianapolis on self guided bike-n-brew tours at the many newly established breweries in Indy or riding just for fun.
